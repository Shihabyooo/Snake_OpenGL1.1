# Snake_OpenGL1.1
An attempt done 3 years ago (2017) while trying to improve my C++ knowledge. A recreation of the classic Snake game using Windows API and Windows SDK's OpenGL 1.1
I haven't worked on this since 2017. Probably should try to refactor/rewrite it with what I've learned since then. It needs a lot of work, but as is, it compiles and plays decently.
